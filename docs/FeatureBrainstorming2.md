I want everything to run on cluster, using components from the CNCF landscape.

I want all infrastructure to be provisioned with Custom Resources (CRs) in kubernetes. So, kubify is an operator and has a set of CRDs that wrap around the installations of other operator CRDs. For example, ray.io has kuberay and has a CR called RayService. In the kubify CRDs, there will also be a RayService CRD that will provide a simplified wrapper around the RayService CRD.

All of the infrastructure-provisioning CRDs will be implemented with inline pulumi python CRs via the pulumi k8s operator, again wrapped around via the kubify operator and CRDs. For example, we'll have a KubernetesCluster CRD in kubify that will provision a kubernetes cluster, given the provider. This kubernetes cluster is opinionated, so it'll come with cluster services that kubify dictates (eg. Pixie BPF, Kaniko for builds, Cert manager, kubecost, etc.).




We want to use best practices in cluster design to address the main concerns of developers, devops engineers, MLops engineers, Director of Engineering, and VP of Engineering.



## Project Plan for Kubify

Given the extensive feature set and the cloud-native approach you want for Kubify, organizing the development into small, manageable releases is crucial. Here's a project plan that breaks down the features into phases, focusing on delivering value incrementally while adhering to best practices in cluster design.

### Phase 0: Bootstrap Cluster
- **Bootstrap Cluster**: Create a local kubernetes cluster and deploy the operator into it. Manage the lifecycle of the bootstrap cluster.

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Basic Operator Functionality
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Develop CRDs for the core infrastructure components, such as `KubernetesCluster`, which will provision a Kubernetes cluster with the specified provider[3][7].
- **Pulumi Integration**: Implement inline Pulumi Python CRs using the Pulumi Kubernetes operator to manage cloud resources[4][8].
- **Basic Operator Logic**: Develop the Kubify operator's basic logic to handle the lifecycle of the CRDs, including creation, update, and deletion[3].

### Phase 2: Developer Experience and CI/CD
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment processes[3].
- **Local Development Environments**: Provide tools to streamline development and testing in local environments[3].
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Develop an intuitive command-line interface with comprehensive documentation and help commands[3].

### Phase 3: Advanced Deployment Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Enhance Kubify to automatically generate Kubernetes deployment manifests from software package information[3].
- **Deployment Management Tools**: Build tools for managing deployment lifecycles, including updates and rollbacks[3].
- **Resource Validation**: Implement validation checks for Kubernetes resources before applying configurations[3].

### Phase 4: Scalability and Performance
- **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling based on performance metrics[3].
- **Load Balancing**: Configure load balancing to distribute traffic across application instances[3].

### Phase 5: Observability and Monitoring
- **Log Aggregation**: Create a system for collecting and aggregating logs from deployed services[3].
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and set up alerting for critical issues[3].
- **Kubecost Integration**: Monitor cloud costs effectively by integrating with Kubecost[3].

### Phase 6: Disaster Recovery
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement backup and restore capabilities for Kubernetes resources and application data[3].

### Phase 7: Security and Compliance
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Integrate RBAC to manage access to Kubify operations[3].
- **Policy Enforcement**: Integrate with policy engines like OPA/Gatekeeper for organizational policy enforcement[3].
- **Audit Trails**: Develop logging mechanisms to maintain detailed operation logs for auditing and troubleshooting[3].

### Phase 8: Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support
- **Cloud-Agnostic Deployment**: Ensure Kubify can deploy across different cloud providers and on-premises environments[3].
- **Hybrid Cloud Management**: Build features to manage applications spanning public and private clouds[3].
