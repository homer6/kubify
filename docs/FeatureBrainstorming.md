

I'm building a new c++ command line application, called kubify. It's job is to understand a software package and launch it into kubernetes. Please give me some things that I'd want kubify to do.


Building upon the initial feature set for your C++ command-line application "kubify" and aligning with cloud-native recommendations, consider incorporating the following additional functionalities:

### Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support
- **Cloud-Agnostic Deployment**: Ensure kubify can deploy applications across different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and on-premises environments, providing flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Hybrid Cloud Management**: Facilitate the management of applications that span across public clouds and on-premises data centers, ensuring consistent deployment and operation.

### Security Enhancements
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to control who can access and perform operations within kubify, enhancing security.
- **Secrets Encryption**: Provide mechanisms for encrypting secrets at rest and in transit within Kubernetes clusters.
- **Network Policies**: Enable the definition and management of network policies to control the flow of traffic between pods and external services, enhancing network security.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to automate the deployment process as part of a continuous integration and delivery pipeline.
- **Rollout Strategies**: Support advanced deployment strategies such as blue-green deployments and canary releases, allowing for safer updates and rollbacks.

### Observability and Diagnostics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Integrate with distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to trace requests across microservices, helping in debugging and performance analysis.
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Facilitate integration with service meshes like Istio or Linkerd to provide advanced traffic management, security, and observability features.

### Developer Experience and Productivity
- **Local Development Environments**: Offer tools or integration with existing tools (e.g., Skaffold, Tilt) to streamline the development and testing of applications in a local environment that mirrors the production setup.
- **Interactive Mode**: Besides the standard CLI, provide an interactive mode that guides users through the deployment process, making it more accessible for beginners.

### Compliance and Governance
- **Policy Enforcement**: Integrate with policy engines (e.g., OPA/Gatekeeper) to enforce organizational policies and best practices across all deployments, ensuring compliance.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all operations and changes made through kubify, supporting audit requirements and troubleshooting.

### Plugin Ecosystem
- **Extensibility through Plugins**: Design kubify with a plugin architecture, allowing the community or users to extend its functionality by developing and integrating custom plugins.

### Disaster Recovery
- **Backup and Restore**: Provide features for backing up Kubernetes resources and application data, and restoring them in case of loss or corruption.

Incorporating these features, guided by cloud-native principles, will make kubify a comprehensive tool that not only simplifies Kubernetes deployments but also ensures they are secure, efficient, and aligned with best practices in a multi-cloud environment.






That's a good start. Let's add more from the cloud native recommendations.


Based on the features you want for your C++ command-line application "kubify," here are some functionalities that would be beneficial to include:

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Automated Deployment**: Kubify should be able to parse software package information and automatically generate Kubernetes deployment manifests (YAML files) for various Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, and Ingresses.
- **Deployment Management**: Provide commands to manage the lifecycle of a deployment, including creating, updating, and deleting deployments.
- **Resource Validation**: Before applying the configurations to Kubernetes, validate them to ensure they are correct and will not cause disruptions in the cluster.

### Logging and Monitoring
- **Log Aggregation**: Kubify should be able to collect and aggregate logs from the Kubernetes pods and services it deploys.
- **Monitoring Integration**: Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to provide insights into the performance and health of the deployed applications.
- **Alerting**: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify users of critical issues with their deployments.

### Scalability
- **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling features that allow applications to scale up or down based on CPU usage, memory consumption, or custom metrics.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensure that kubify can configure load balancing rules to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of an application.

### Configuration Management
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Provide a way to manage Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment-specific configurations.
- **Version Control**: Integrate with version control systems to track changes in the configuration and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.

### Package Analysis
- **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze software package dependencies to ensure that all required services are deployed and configured.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in the software packages before deployment.

### Additional Features
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Design a command-line interface that is intuitive and provides helpful feedback to the user.
- **Documentation and Help**: Include comprehensive documentation and built-in help commands to assist users in using kubify effectively.
- **Cloud Provider Integration**: Allow kubify to interact with different cloud providers' APIs for cloud-specific features and configurations.

These features would make kubify a robust tool for deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes, providing users with a streamlined process for container orchestration.

I want everything to run on cluster, using components from the CNCF landscape.

I want all infrastructure to be provisioned with Custom Resources (CRs) in kubernetes. So, kubify is an operator and has a set of CRDs that wrap around the installations of other operator CRDs. For example, ray.io has kuberay and has a CR called RayService. In the kubify CRDs, there will also be a RayService CRD that will provide a simplified wrapper around the RayService CRD.

All of the infrastructure-provisioning CRDs will be implemented with inline pulumi python CRs via the pulumi k8s operator, again wrapped around via the kubify operator and CRDs. For example, we'll have a KubernetesCluster CRD in kubify that will provision a kubernetes cluster, given the provider. This kubernetes cluster is opinionated, so it'll come with cluster services that kubify dictates (eg. Pixie BPF, Kaniko for builds, Cert manager, kubecost, etc.).




We want to use best practices in cluster design to address the main concerns of developers, devops engineers, MLops engineers, Director of Engineering, and VP of Engineering.













Let's rewrite this plan into a project plan for. Organize the features into small releases.


## Project Plan for Kubify

Given the extensive feature set and the cloud-native approach you want for Kubify, organizing the development into small, manageable releases is crucial.
